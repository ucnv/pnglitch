        The size of your data goes over #{over_size}.
        It should be #{expected_size} actually when it's a normal
        formatted PNG file.
        PNGlitch raised this error to avoid the attack known as
        "zip bomb". If you are sure that the PNG image is safe,
        please set manually your own upper size limit as the variable
        of PNGlitch#open.
